This is a assignment from my study. The assignment
was to build a website for a online shoe store with
backend. Where a user could log into the backend and
add/delete/edit products on the site. The products are
fetched from an API hosted locally on strapi API.

The strapi API files are a bit large, so i havent uploaded
them here. But if your interested, check out my code!
